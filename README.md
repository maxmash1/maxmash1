### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Mashrur, a **Field Solutions Engineer** at _**GitHub**_ ðŸ”­. Our team mascot is the ðŸ¦™ (llama) and I'm a programmer so I guess you can call me:
## Llamagrammer! 

Some of the things I'm learning/working on are
- ðŸŒ± [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- ðŸ‘¯ [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security#about-github-advanced-security)
- ðŸ¤” and a few more topics ...

ðŸ’¬ O wait, did I mention that I am a programming instructor? Yup, I teach how to code, check it out [Lifting coder](https://www.mashrurhossain.com/)

Enjoy!
